# I'm a dedicated QA Engineer with experience in web application testing and data validation using SQL. Skilled in creating, executing, and maintaining manual and semi-automated test cases. Proficient in error analysis, documentation, and tracking throughout the entire error resolution process. My work is characterized by a high level of attention to detail, analytical thinking, and a strong commitment to quality. After a career break, I've refreshed and expanded my skills with modern QA tools, API testing, and CI/CD workflows.
